Progetto di Ingegneria del Software

## Run using the JAR file
Once installed all requirements and compiled the project, open a terminal and
go to the project target directory. 
Once there it is possible to choose to run the server or the client (CLI or GUI):

### Run the Server
bash
java -jar Server.jar -i "Your ip"

### Run the Client (CLI)
bash
java -jar Client.jar -c

or
bash
java -jar Client.jar --cli


### Run the Client (GUI)
bash
java -jar Eriantys.jar

To run the Client (GUI) it is also possible to open the JAR file directly from
the file explorer.

### Recommendations

In order to play, you'll have to launch at least one server and two clients (either CLI or GUI).

*WARNING*: For the best GUI experience it is strongly suggested to play with a screen resolution
of 1920x1080 (100% DPI) and with a scaling of 100%.
